GaterTrader is a web platform exclusive for San Francisco State University (SFSU) students, staff, and faculty to sell and share content that may be useful to all. It was built by SFSU students for the SFSU community. Students and faculty will immediately see a benefit from the school-friendly categorization of media by course and field of study. Professors will be able to publish their syllabi, notes, and handouts in one place. Students, for example, will have the opportunity to be rewarded for their creativity by facilitating buying and selling of media. The project was developed as part of the Software Engineering (course CSC648) capstone project.
