      I am a senior undergraduate computer science major at San Francisco State
      University expecting to graduate Fall 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in
      Computer Science and a Certificate in Data Science and Machine Learning
      for Biotechnology. I have worked on projects and coursework that have
      given me experience in machine learning, web development, embedded
      software, and virtual and augmented reality. I have years of experience
      instructing and supporting students with disabilities as a paraeducator. I
      am fluent in English and Portuguese and some proficiency in Italian and
      Spanish.
